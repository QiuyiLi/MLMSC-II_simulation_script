# MLMSC-II_simulation_script
 
We provide the scripts to reproduce the simulation results of the paper **The effect of copy number hemiplasy on gene family evolution**. Here we only give the example of the species tree of 16 fungal genomes i.e., the result presented in the main text of the paper. Minor changes to the python scripts is required to reproduce the examples of primate species tree, or the artificial species tree with extremely short internal branches. 

For more details, please refer to the README.md file in each individual directory.
