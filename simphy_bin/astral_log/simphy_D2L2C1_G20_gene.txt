================== ASTRAL-Pro ===================== 

This is ASTRAL-Pro (A-Pro) version 1.1.3
Using native AVX batch computing.
Gene trees are treated as unrooted
There are 4 threads used to run.
The number of input tree read is 20
312 trees read from ./astral_input/simphy_D2L2C1_G20_gene.newick
30 extra trees.
All output trees will be *arbitrarily* rooted at N

======== Running the main analysis
Number of taxa: 16 (16 species)
Taxa: [N, O, P, M, L, J, K, F, C, A, B, D, E, I, H, G]
Taxon occupancy: {A=270, B=286, C=286, D=286, E=264, F=200, G=248, H=216, I=216, J=236, K=220, L=200, M=200, N=224, O=264, P=244}
