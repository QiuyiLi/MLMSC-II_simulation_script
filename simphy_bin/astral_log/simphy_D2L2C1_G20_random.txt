================== ASTRAL-Pro ===================== 

This is ASTRAL-Pro (A-Pro) version 1.1.3
Using native AVX batch computing.
Gene trees are treated as unrooted
There are 4 threads used to run.
The number of input tree read is 20
320 trees read from ./astral_input/simphy_D2L2C1_G20_random.newick
20 extra trees.
All output trees will be *arbitrarily* rooted at B

======== Running the main analysis
Number of taxa: 16 (16 species)
Taxa: [B, A, C, D, E, F, H, G, I, P, O, N, L, M, J, K]
Taxon occupancy: {A=224, B=224, C=224, D=224, E=240, F=176, G=176, H=256, I=176, J=272, K=240, L=304, M=320, N=240, O=256, P=304}
Using polytree-based weight calculation.
