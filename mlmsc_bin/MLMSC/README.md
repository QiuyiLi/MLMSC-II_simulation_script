# The MLMSC-II Simulator

The MLMSC-II Simulator is a program for the simulation of gene family evolution within a species tree based on the updated Multilocus Multipecies Coalescent (MLMSC-II) model. The MLMSC-II model generalises the multispecies coalescent to gene families, and is designed to capture all possible scenarios that can arise through incomplete lineage sorting, gene duplication, transfer and loss, and any interaction between these processes. The MLMSC-II combines forward- and backward-in-time modelling in order to properly account for copy number hemiplasy and linkage between loci.

## Obtaining the program

### Download

The source code of MLMSC Simulator is available in the GitHub repository:
```
https://github.com/QiuyiLi/MLMSC-II
```
You can clone the sources in your computer by executing:
```
git clone https://github.com/QiuyiLi/MLMSC-II.git
```

### Requirements
MLMSC Simulator is built under Python 3.7.2 and requirs the installation of the following packages: 
```
scikit-bio
numpy
statistics
```
You can install these packages by executing:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Testing

The MLMSC Simulator should be ready to use now. You can test the the simulator by executing:
```
python3 MLMSC.py -i species_trees/ex_tree.newick -s 0
```
The simulator will run with the default settings and you should be able to see the following output:
```
gene tree:
